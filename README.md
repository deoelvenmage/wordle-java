# Overview

You know what it is. You read the title of this project. New language, new Wordle. Basic command-line word-guessing game with some handling for unusual user input. It does  in the command line. We've got a limited wordbank, but it reads from a file and handles words dynamically, which means the wordbank is easier to expand.

I built this to help learn some of the syntax and ideas of programming in Java. As such, it's probably done weirdly and inefficiently, but we all have to start somewhere.

# Future Work

* Improve file handling (post-file processing via stringsplitting?) to allow for any whitespace between words instead of just newlines
* Change game logic to only display the rules once when you select a game
* Implement other WordGames, like Hangman
